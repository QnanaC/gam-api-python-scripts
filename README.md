After many years, tried writing scripts for GAM API again to do tasks not available via UI - AI assisted.

Updates: 01/30/2026
alllabels.py    // GAM Interactive Reporting can no longer report on Labels to pull all labels in the system then writes to CSV.  This pulls everything and includes id, types, name, adCategory, isActive.
companylabels_csv.py  // Pulls all Companies and maps Labels applied, writes to CSV.
